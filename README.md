# CCNet-Pure-Pytorch
Criss-Cross Attention for Semantic Segmentation in pure Pytorch with faster and more precise implementation.
## Introduction
We re-implement CCNet: Criss-Cross Attention for Semantic Segmentation in pure Pytorch for better compatibility under different versions and environments. Previous many open-source projects employ a Cuda extension for Pytorch, which suffer from problems of compatibility and precision loss. Moreover, Cuda extension may not be optimized and accelerated by Pytorch.
