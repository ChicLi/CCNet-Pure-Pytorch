# CCNet-Pure-Pytorch
Criss-Cross Attention for Semantic Segmentation in pure Pytorch with faster and more precise implementation.
## Introduction
I unofficially re-implement [CCNet: Criss-Cross Attention for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11721) in pure Pytorch for better compatibility under different versions and environments. Previous many open-source projects employ a Cuda extension for Pytorch, which suffer from problems of compatibility and precision loss. Moreover, Cuda extension may not be optimized and accelerated by Pytorch, when we set cudnn.benchmark = True. To address these issues, I design a Criss-Cross Attention operation in our [CC.py] based on tensor transformation in Pytorch, which is implemented in parallel and shows a faster speed and more precise in forward and backward gradient.
